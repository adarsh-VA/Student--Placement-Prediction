   <h1> Student Placement Prediction</h1>
</div>

**Black Friday** marks the beginning of the Christmas shopping festival across the US. On Black Friday big shopping giants like Amazon, Flipkart, etc. lure customers by offering discounts and deals on different product categories. The product categories range from electronic items, Clothing, kitchen appliances, Décor. Research has been carried out to predict sales by various researchers. The analysis of this data serves as a basis to provide discounts on various product items. With the purpose of analyzing and predicting the sales, we have used three models. The dataset Black Friday Sales Dataset available on Kaggle has been used for analysis and prediction purposes.

# Getting Started :

## Algorithm Used 
- In **Random forest** n number of random records are taken from the data set having k number of records.
- Individual decision trees are constructed for each sample.
- Each decision tree will generate an output.
- Final output is considered based on Majority Voting or Averaging for Classification and regression respectively

## Algorithm Used 
- Data Description
- Data preprocessing
- Evaluation model

## Conclusion 
The Project Implementation is being done properly. The proposed system will utilize Decision Tree Algorithms and provide a simple and very interactive user interface so that anyone with basic computer operation skills can utilize the full potential of the application.
 
All these predictions help the institute to improvise the student performance and can come up with 100% results. . We can also enhance the project by predicting some solutions or suggestions for the output generated by system.
